## 4. Production Readiness Assessment

### 4.1 Issue #2 Resolution Verification

**Original Problem**: 
> "dune_build_status MCP tool was failing due to exceeding 25,000 token limits"

**Solution Implementation**:

```
🔧 TOKEN LIMIT SYSTEM:
   ✅ Hard limit: 25,000 tokens
   ✅ Soft limit: 20,000 tokens (5k metadata buffer)
   ✅ Conservative estimation: ~4 chars per token + overhead
   ✅ Automatic truncation with clear reasoning
   ✅ Token count included in response

🔧 ENHANCED FUNCTIONALITY:
   ✅ Error prioritization ensures critical info appears first
   ✅ Filtering reduces noise (severity + file patterns)
   ✅ Pagination enables navigation of large diagnostic sets
   ✅ Rich summaries provide diagnostic overview
   ✅ Backward compatibility preserves existing integrations

🔧 PRODUCTION QUALITY:
   ✅ Comprehensive error handling
   ✅ Input validation and bounds checking
   ✅ JSON schema with field validation
   ✅ Performance optimizations
   ✅ Documentation and clear API
```

### 4.2 Scalability Assessment

#### Large Codebase Handling
- **Token Management**: Scales linearly with diagnostic count
- **Memory Usage**: Constant per diagnostic, bounded by limits
- **Response Time**: Filtering and pagination prevent timeout issues
- **User Experience**: Progressive disclosure through pagination

#### Edge Case Coverage
```
✅ Empty diagnostic sets (no warnings/errors)
✅ Very large diagnostic sets (thousands of issues)
✅ Long error messages (proper token estimation)
✅ Deep directory structures (recursive glob matching)
✅ Invalid pagination requests (bounds checking)
✅ Mixed severity levels (proper prioritization)
✅ Legacy API calls (backward compatibility)
```

### 4.3 Error Handling Robustness

**Error Recovery Strategies**:
- Dune connection failures: Clear error messages
- Invalid parameters: Validation with helpful feedback
- Token limit exceeded: Graceful truncation with explanation
- Page out of bounds: Informative error with valid ranges
- Pattern matching failures: Fallback to showing all files
